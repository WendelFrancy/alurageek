# Oracle One AluraBook Challenge

## A challenge from the Oracle One to front-end students, create a website that allows you to create and delete cards as you want.

This project design was sent on Figma by the Oracle ONE team, and the challenge was to create it using HTML, CSS, and JS.

The worst thing that happened when I was building the website was get the file from `<input type="file">` and translate it to a
URL Link that can land on `<img src="here"`. I used the API FileReader() to do it.

## How did I do that!? You can see the step-by-step process below.

* Analyze the design details.
* Build the entire HTML using semantic tags and link the CSS and JavaScript to it.
* Write the JavaScript codes.
* Make sure that the functions `guardarProduto()` and `excluirProduto()` are performing well.
* Ensure responsiveness.
